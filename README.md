### 1.What is Version Control?
##### Version Control is a system that helps developers track and manage changes to files (especially code) over time.
##### It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
##### Think of it as a "time machine" for your code – you can go back to earlier versions if something goes wrong.
#### Why Use Version Control?
##### Track Changes – See what changed, who changed it, and when.
##### Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same project.
##### Backup – Your code history is safely stored.
##### Restore – Easily revert to previous versions if you make a mistake.
##### Branching & Merging – Work on new features without affecting the main project.

### Types of Version Control
#### 1. Local Version Control
##### Stores versions on your local machine.
#### 2.  Centralized Version Control (CVCS)
##### A single server stores all code versions.
##### 3. Distributed Version Control (DVCS)
##### Every developer has a full copy of the repository.
#### Popular Version Control Systems


### Git
##### Git is the most popular Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
##### It helps developers track changes, collaborate, and manage code history in software projects.
#####  With Git, every developer has a full copy of the project repository (not just the latest version).


### Pre-commit hooks
#### 1. Definition
##### A pre-commit hook is a script that runs automatically before a commit is created in Git.
##### It ensures that only clean, valid, and properly formatted code is committed
#### 2. Why Use Pre-commit Hooks?
##### Prevent committing code with syntax errors.
##### Maintain consistent coding style (formatting, indentation).
##### Run tests or linters before allowing a commit.
##### Stop accidental commits of large files or secrets.
##### Ensure commit messages follow rules (when used with other hooks).
