What is Version Control?

Version Control is a system that helps developers track and manage changes to files (especially code) over time.

It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.

Think of it as a "time machine" for your code – you can go back to earlier versions if something goes wrong.

🎯 Why Use Version Control?

Track Changes – See what changed, who changed it, and when.

Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same project.

Backup – Your code history is safely stored.

Restore – Easily revert to previous versions if you make a mistake.

Branching & Merging – Work on new features without affecting the main project.
### Pre-commit hooks
#### 1. Definition
##### A pre-commit hook is a script that runs automatically before a commit is created in Git.
##### It ensures that only clean, valid, and properly formatted code is committed
#### 2. Why Use Pre-commit Hooks?
##### Prevent committing code with syntax errors.
##### Maintain consistent coding style (formatting, indentation).
##### Run tests or linters before allowing a commit.
##### Stop accidental commits of large files or secrets.
##### Ensure commit messages follow rules (when used with other hooks).
