### 1.What is Version Control?
##### Version Control is a system that helps developers track and manage changes to files (especially code) over time.
##### It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
##### Think of it as a "time machine" for your code â€“ you can go back to earlier versions if something goes wrong.
#### 2. Why Use Version Control?
##### Track Changes â€“ See what changed, who changed it, and when.
##### Collaboration â€“ Multiple developers can work on the same project.
##### Backup â€“ Your code history is safely stored.
##### Restore â€“ Easily revert to previous versions if you make a mistake.
##### Branching & Merging â€“ Work on new features without affecting the main project.

### Types of Version Control
#### 1. Local Version Control
##### Stores versions on your local machine.
#### 2.  Centralized Version Control (CVCS)
##### A single server stores all code versions.
#### 3. Distributed Version Control (DVCS)
##### Every developer has a full copy of the repository.
#### Popular Version Control Systems


### Git
##### Git is the most popular Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
##### It helps developers track changes, collaborate, and manage code history in software projects.
#####  With Git, every developer has a full copy of the project repository (not just the latest version).

## GitHub
### ðŸ“Œ Definition
##### GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.
##### It provides a web interface to store, share, and collaborate on projects using Git.
#####  Think of Git as the engine, and GitHub as the car with a nice dashboard.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features of GitHub
##### Remote Repository Hosting â€“ Store your Git repos online.
##### Collaboration â€“ Work with teams using pull requests, issues, and discussions.
##### Version Control â€“ Powered by Git under the hood.
##### Code Review â€“ Review code changes before merging.
##### Project Management â€“ Built-in tools (projects, issues, milestones).
##### Actions (CI/CD) â€“ Automate testing, deployment, etc.
##### Open Source Community â€“ Millions of public repositories to learn and contribute.

### Branching permissions ----> Developers can work on other branches, but canâ€™t directly change the main branch; changes must be reviewed first.

### Benefits of GitHub
##### Central place for code collaboration.
##### Free hosting for public repos.
##### Integration with tools (Slack, Jira, CI/CD).
##### Popular in open-source development.
### Widely used in open source


### GitLab
#### ðŸ“Œ Definition
##### GitLab is a web-based DevOps platform that provides Git repository hosting and a full set of tools for the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
##### Like GitHub, it uses Git under the hood, but it also has built-in CI/CD pipelines, project management, and deployment features.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features of GitLab
##### Git Repository Hosting â€“ Manage and share your Git projects.
##### Collaboration Tools â€“ Issues, merge requests, wikis, code review.
##### CI/CD Pipelines â€“ Automate build, test, and deployment inside GitLab.
##### Project Management â€“ Milestones, Kanban boards, roadmaps.
##### Security & Monitoring â€“ Built-in security scanning and monitoring.
##### Self-Hosted Option â€“ Can run GitLab on your own server (unlike GitHub which is mostly cloud-based).
##### DevOps in One Platform â€“ Source code + CI/CD + project management in one place.
### Widely used in enterprises

### Branching permissions ---->Developers can push to some branches, but moving changes to the main branch needs approval from team members.


### Bitbucket
### ðŸ“Œ Definition
##### Bitbucket is a Git-based code hosting platform developed by Atlassian.
##### Like GitHub and GitLab, it allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code repositories.
#####  It is deeply integrated with Atlassian tools like Jira, Trello, and Confluence, making it popular in companies using the Atlassian ecosystem.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features of Bitbucket
#####  Git & Mercurial Support â€“ (Initially supported both, now mainly Git).
#####  Collaboration Tools â€“ Pull requests, inline comments, code reviews.
#####  CI/CD Pipelines â€“ Built-in Bitbucket Pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
#####  Integration with Atlassian Products â€“ Strong Jira, Trello, and Confluence integration.
#####  Free Private Repositories â€“ Unlike GitHub (in the past), Bitbucket always allowed free private repos.
#####  Branch Permissions ------>  Developers can push to allowed branches, but important branches have strict rules and need approvals before changes are merged.
#####  Self-hosted option â€“ Bitbucket Server / Data Center for companies that want to host internally.



### Saving Changes in Git
##### In Git, saving your changes means storing snapshots of your files in the repository. This is done in two steps: staging and committing.

#### 1. Check the Status of Your Files
#### Syntax : <  git status >
##### Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked.
##### Helps you know what will be saved.

#### 2. Stage Changes
#### Add the files you want to save (prepare them for commit):
#### Syntax :  <git add [file_name] > this is for spefic file.
#### Syntax : <git add  . > this is for adding all the entire file in the folder.



### Pre-commit hooks
#### 1. Definition
##### A pre-commit hook is a script that runs automatically before a commit is created in Git.
##### It ensures that only clean, valid, and properly formatted code is committed
#### 2. Why Use Pre-commit Hooks?
##### Prevent committing code with syntax errors.
##### Maintain consistent coding style (formatting, indentation).
##### Run tests or linters before allowing a commit.
##### Stop accidental commits of large files or secrets.
##### Ensure commit messages follow rules (when used with other hooks).
